# Office Support System for Not-for-Profit Organizations
This project presents an open-source office support system designed for small
not-for-profit organizations (NPOs), which typically operate with limited staff and
resources. These organizations manage a high volume of communication through
emails, phone calls, social media, and in-person visits, and must regularly generate
detailed reports for donors and government agencies. 

To address the challenges of
manual tracking and fragmented workflows, our solution enables staff to efficiently
categorize and assign communications, automate follow-up task distribution, and
generate structured monthly or yearly reports. The system integrates machine
learning to assist with communication categorization, reducing administrative
burden and improving consistency. 

The tool is implemented as a Microsoft Outlook Add-in, with a Visual Basic scripting layer that automates email parsing and data
logging. This approach ensures seamless integration with existing workflows and
maximizes adoption by working within a familiar environment. The final product is
a lightweight, privacy-conscious solution that simplifies communication
management and report generation. Freely available to small NPOs, the system is
designed to enhance productivity, transparency, and organizational efficiency
without introducing unnecessary complexity.
